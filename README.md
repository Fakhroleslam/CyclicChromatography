# CyclicChromatography
Simulation code for the paper "Cyclic Chromatography Processes as Hybrid Systems: Dynamic Simulation and Optimal Design for 5-HMF/Water Separation". This project explores a two-bed, four-step cyclic chromatography process for the separation of 5-HMF from water, implemented using MATLAB s-functions and Stateflow Chart in Simulink.
